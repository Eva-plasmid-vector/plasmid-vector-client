Our mission: store, express, and transmit truths about diseases that you would think you know. 

Today, there are numerous physical diseases and mental disorders that are neglected/stigmatized/misunderstood by the public. Here, we want to use simple and intriguing examples, stories, and graphics to present them as thorough as possible. 
Like passing information between individual’s genome, our Plasmid Vector website intends to become a medium that carries the knowledge of physical diseases and mental disorders, transfers that into accessible facts, and deciphers the language across different professions.  

Our team is comprised of two biology students who are both equally passionate in psychology and neuroscience. After noticing some stigmas and misunderstandings associated with physical diseases/mental disorders, coupling with our personal background and experience, we decided to do something. That’s when we took our action: started to build the website and compose the presented content.
